# Study Helper (Similar to Quizlet)
This console-based Python game is similar to the functionality of Quizlet or a flashcard game. Users are able to add terms and definitions and be tested on them. The program randomly chooses one definition from the list of definitions and asks the user to respond with the term. The game continues until the user inputs "stop".

## Requirements
- Python 3.x (Python 3.6 or later recommended)

## Installation
No additional packages are required since this script uses Python's built-in `json`, `random`, and `sys` modules.

## Usage
1. Make sure you have the appropriate Python environment set up.
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
3. Output: The script will print the array of dictionaries to the console.
